Age vs Health Risk

Predicted probability of high health risk increases with age. The logistic S-curve shows a sharp rise at middle ages followed by saturation, confirming age as a key risk factor.

⸻

Sleep Duration vs Health Risk

Sleep duration shows a negative relationship with health risk. Individuals with shorter sleep durations are more likely to be classified as high risk, while longer sleep durations correspond to lower predicted risk.

⸻

BMI vs Health Risk

BMI exhibits a strong nonlinear effect on health risk. The probability of high risk increases rapidly beyond a BMI threshold and then plateaus, highlighting BMI as a dominant predictor.

⸻

Predicted Probability Distribution

Predicted probabilities are concentrated near 0 and 1, indicating high model confidence and strong separation between low- and high-risk individuals.

⸻

Decision Tree Insights

The decision tree identifies BMI, age, exercise, sleep duration, smoking, alcohol consumption, and sugar intake as key decision variables. The tree provides clear, interpretable rules showing how lifestyle and demographic factors combine to influence health risk.

⸻

Summary

Logistic regression captures smooth probability trends, while the decision tree offers interpretable decision rules. Together, they provide robust and explainable health risk classification
